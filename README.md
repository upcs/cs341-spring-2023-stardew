# 1. Visual/Aesthetics
The repository primarily focuses on user experience to allow clients of all ages to access the website without any issue. In doing so, we placed a major emphasis on the object interactions of website, routing of pages, and how website looks based on screen size. We used the colors white and green along with fonts requested by our client to reflect the theme of the company and easy to understand icons/images that support routing/javascript features.

# 2. Login Security Implementation + Password
We prioritized creating a database to store login/password information hashed to prevent malicious access of information. To allow users to easily login to the webpage, a login/signup/forgot password page exists that posts information on the server side to generate necessary information. If user fails to login due to wrong email/password, text will be generated to inform the user that either the email or password is incorrect.

# 3. Ease of Use
As stated earlier, we primarily focused on the user experience of the website. In doing so, we made sizing of text and buttons big enough to allow users to easily see what kind of actions they can do. Furthermore, hovering towards certain actions will change the color, indicating that user can perform action.
